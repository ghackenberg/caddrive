  abstract = {Machines and plants continuously increase in complexity due to higher customer expectations regarding their purpose and flexibility of use. For this reason, machines and plants development processes need to adapt continuously to the present situation. In addition, the growing meaning of electronic and software components in machines and plants complicates the engineering since the interaction of different disciplines leads to increasing coordination efforts and problems regarding the interface between these disciplines. To face these challenges, the suitable handling of arising requirements is one key factor for the success of engineering processes. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary modeling technique for requirements management is presented in this paper. After a summary of approaches for model-based development and requirements management in the context of mechatronic systems engineering, the modeling technique with its concepts, terms, tasks and workflows is illustrated. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the modeling technique was applied to a miniaturized packaging plant, which is currently developed at the Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb) of Technische Universität München for teaching students and benchmarking engineering methods and tools. Finally, an outlook with extensions of the concept for fault-tolerant systems and the integration of further engineering tools in order to promote a consistent engineering tool-chain is given.}

  abstract = {Various drivers, especially increasing market dynamics, force industrial enterprises to evolve their production facilities ever more frequently. Analyzing the impact of changed requirements on the production facilities early in the engineering process would facilitate the estimation of resulting costs and therefore reduce project risk. In industrial practice, requirements specifications are typically textual lists and only structured by a table of contents; an analysis of the impact of changes within the requirements specification is extensive, as no documented information is available about how the requirements and other elements of the requirements specification depend on each other. To identify impacts of changes in a requirements specification more efficiently, this paper proposes a model-based approach that classifies the elements of a requirements specification according to their contents and based on the classification preselects automatically candidate elements of the requirements specification that are possibly affected by the change. This paper shows the application of the approach on the manufacturing automation systems domain by means of a pick and place unit (PPU) demonstrator. The technical validation demonstrates that in the example of the PPU the impact analysis is more efficient with a content model than on an unstructured list; the effort for impact analysis is reduced further when adapting the content model to the manufacturing automation systems domain.}

Requirements are presented as a component of the integrated design knowledge framework.

However, since there are many different approaches for Systems Engineering, this paper considers Generic Systems Engineering (GSE) as a generally valid and proven approach. Furthermore, Systems Engineering can be applied to many different objects. For this purpose, the paper focuses on organization systems. This is due to the fact that the increasingly dynamic markets generate new or changing requirements that affect not only the production and development of technical products, but also the business processes in companies. This implicates, for instance, the infrastructure and the interfaces of business processes, the identification of responsible persons respectively roles, and moreover, the traceability of the information flow between persons and IT systems within the business processes. In order to manage the vast complexity of organizational structures in system modeling, the enhanced Demand Compliant Design (e-DeCoDe) approach is considered as an implicit part of Generic Systems Engineering. Hence, in this paper, we analyze, evaluate, and discuss different software tools and examine their suitability to ensure the model-based development of complex organizational systems using the Generic Systems Engineering and enhanced Demand Compliant Design approach.},

  abstract = {The crucial factor for a successful usage of modeling approaches of systems engineering is the interaction of language, method, and tool. For this, specific challenges arise for the application of MBSE in agile requirements engineering. From observations in agile development practice at a machine tool manufacturer, the challenges for model-based requirements engineering are described and each is assigned to its critical aspect of modeling: The language must formally represent the requirements data model, especially for planning engineering generations. The tool must support collaborative, interdisciplinary cooperation, and consider the dynamics of the requirements model during the development process. The method must individually support the requirements engineering activities, which are carried out several times in a sprint during the development process and must enable a target-oriented process for bundling the requirements into engineering generations. Taking these demands into account, an approach is then presented providing activity-based views in conjunction with activity steps based on a consistent ontology for the description of product requirements and verification activities. The activity steps are composed in activity patterns and support the user in making use of the views for modeling requirements for the engineering generations. The approach is implemented in the software JIRA at a machine tool manufacturer. The subsequent evaluation shows that the approach is used in development practice and offers the potential to plan engineering generation systematically and comprehensibly and to ensure a regular review of the implemented requirements.}

In this paper, we examine the various challenges of RQM, especially related to PLM. Company-specific challenges are identified, when integrating RQM with PLM in a case company acting in the automotive industry. The objective of this study is to find out how product-related information on customer requirements could better be utilised and integrated with PLM. We propose a new integration framework according to which the challenges at different integration levels are categorised. As a final conclusion, the study shows the core points where and how the concepts of PLM and RQM should be developed, as to create requirements integrated solutions for extended products and systems through the lifecycle. }

  abstract  = { Large high-technology companies operate in fiercely competitive international markets. To succeed, they need to shorten the cycle time of new product development (NPD) while improving product quality and maintaining or reducing the total resources required. Their abilities to meet these business goals depend on how extensively and effectively they collect, analyze, and utilize requirements in their product development. Creating and sharing such knowledge is complicated partly because the NPD activities of large companies are geographically distributed. Groupware technologies allow knowledge to be created and shared more effectively. Thus, they hold considerable potential as means of meeting the goals. Yet, little theory-based guidance is available to help design groupware-based requirements management systems (RMS) for large geographically distributed organizations. In this article, we draw on existing literature and experiences from large-scale distributed industrial development projects at Nokia to start building a design theory that answers the following question: What are the necessary and sufficient properties of RMS, and how should RMS be designed and introduced in large high-technology companies to best achieve the business goals? The main contributions of the article are (a) the creation of a generic set of requirements for RMS, (b) the development of the RMS design, and (c) the empirical validation of the design by analyzing instantiations of the design at various product lines of Nokia. }

Development models such as the waterfall model, spiral model, rational unified process, agile and many others have looked at efficiency of the development processes. These approaches have helped practitioners improve immensely on the efficiency and efficacy of the product development processes. However, product quality needs to be measured by parameters that go beyond the traditional criteria like performance, reliability, reusability etc. A product that has any interaction with the end user also needs to meet a fundamental requirement of being “user friendly”. Development models such as JAD (Joint Application Development) have focused on making products user friendly. Apart from achieving the technical soundness in a product, the success of the product also largely depends on how well the product addresses the primary requirements of the user such as desirability, relevance and usability. Not meeting these requirements leads to bad user experience, which, in turn can actually lead to failure of the product. This paper discusses some of the misconceptions and myths that exist in the industry regarding Requirements Engineering (RE) and User Experience Design (UXD), and how user needs typically slip through the cracks under the name of “non functional requirements”. The paper highlights the need for RE and UXD focus during the overall product development life cycle. In the concluding section an integrated framework for RE and UXD in the PLM process is presented.},

The number of different agile approaches has also increased over time. Despite the various agile approaches, it has been shown that companies in product development have difficulties in integrating these approaches and a change process is extremely complex. This results in the need for suitable methodological support that generates situation-dependent and company-specific process solutions and thus addresses and achieves different and individual goals. For this, the complex and company-specific adaptation of an organizational unit needs to be tailored to the needs and situation of the affected organization. This is made possible by an individual agile-structuring process solution, which is generated on the basis of a methodical support in the form of a framework, which is developed in this article on basis of current research. Based on this framework, process authors are enabled to generate an agile structuring process solution for the organizational unit concerned, which enables a suitable, company-specific combination of agile and plan-driven approaches and elements. By applying the framework, a specific organizational unit is given the ability to implement an appropriate degree of agility in its development process through the generated process solution. This reduces the expected difficulties of agile approaches in product development and enables the organization to react more flexibly and adaptively to unpredictable and changing situations.}

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, digitization has invaded all areas of human activity, including innovation. The result of digitization of existing tools for design and collaboration, and the introduction of entirely new digital tools, is a far more substantive change of innovation than previous generations of tools enabled. It affects not only the quality of the output and speed of its generation, but it affects the innovation work itself, changes work content, collaboration patterns, decision authority, organizational set-ups, governance structures, firm boundaries, and ultimately entire ecosystems. In this paper, the digitization of New Product Development (NPD), a subset of innovation, is studied to pursue two research questions: (1) How has the digital tool landscape in NPD changed over the past 15 years, and (2) how have these changes affected how firms innovate? This research uses a longitudinal multi-method, qualitative approach to deep dive into actual use cases of digital design tools such as computer-aided design CAD and new tools such as collaborative information technology (CIT). The changes in these tools and observations into how these tools are transforming the very nature of how things are designed is the research focus of this study. These tools have become increasingly more sophisticated while being easier to use and are integrated earlier in the design process. As a result, digital tools have a far broader reaching impact than previous generation of tools. Not only do they affect output and process efficiency, but they also increase depth and breadth of the work of individual innovators, they lead to rearrangement of the entire innovation processes, enable new configurations of people, teams, and firms, and rewrite the rules on how knowledge management acts as a critical competitive capability. The progression of digitization is laying the groundwork for changes to what firms are and do and points to different ways of organizing, specializing, and training for NPD professionals.},

  abstract = {For more than a decade, researchers have explored the benefits of eliminating organizational boundaries between participants in the new product development (NPD) process. In turn, companies have revamped their NPD processes and organizational structures to deploy cross-functional teams. These efforts toward interfunctional integration have produced a more responsive NPD process, but they don't represent the endgame in the quest for more effective NPD. What's next after the interfunctional walls come down? Pointing out that many high-tech firms have already taken such steps as integrating customers and suppliers into the NPD process, Avan Jassawalla and Hemant Sashittal suggest that such firms need to go beyond integration and start thinking in terms of collaboration. Using information from a study of 10 high-tech industrial firms, they identify factors that seem to increase cross-functional collaboration in NPD, and they develop a conceptual framework that relates those factors to the level of cross-functional collaboration achieved in the NPD process. Compared to integration, collaboration is described as a more complex, higher intensity cross-functional linkage. In addition to high levels of integration, their definition of cross-functional collaboration includes the sense of an equal stake in NPD outcomes, the absence of hidden agendas, and a willingness on the part of participants to understand and accept differences while remaining focused on the organization's common objectives. Collaboration also involves synergy—that is, the NPD outcomes exceed the sum of the capabilities of the individual participants in the NPD process. Their framework suggests that structural mechanisms such as cross-functional teams can provide significant increases in NPD-related interfunctional integration. However, high levels of integration do not necessarily equate to high levels of collaboration. Characteristics of the organization and the participants also affect the level of collaboration. For example, achieving a high level of collaboration depends on participants who contribute an openness to change, a willingness to cooperate, and a high level of trust. Their framework also points to key organizational factors that affect the level of collaboration—for example, the priority that senior management gives to NPD and the level of autonomy afforded to participants in the NPD process.},

Using the knowledge-based theory as a foundation, this study examines if, and how, particular IT tools used in the discovery, development, and commercialization phases of the new product development (NPD) process influence NPD effectiveness dimensions, namely, market performance, innovativeness, and quality of a new product. Based on data collected from NPD managers in the US and Canada, the findings indicate that specific IT tools contribute to various measures of new product effectiveness differently. Moreover, the results show the positive effect of these IT tools in different phases of the NPD process. This suggests that with regard to NPD, a decompositional approach that examines the role of IT within each phase of the NPD process is best. Based on these findings, the authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of the study and suggest paths for future research. Managerially, some interesting results of our study are that decision support systems, file transfer protocols, and concept testing tools would significantly improve NPD effectiveness regardless of the phase they are used.}

  abstract = {Open innovation has recently begun to receive increasing attention in organizational research. Studies on open innovation have emphasized the impact of organizational structure on both inbound and outbound open innovation but have tended to focus on the former. This study attempts to provide a better understanding of open innovation within the context of open source by examining 2,811 projects, especially in GitHub. The analysis results reveal that the decentralization of decision-making encourages both inbound and outbound open innovation. The impact of the decentralization of decision-making differs between inbound and outbound open innovation, a finding that both scholars and practitioners must consider.}

  abstract  = {Open source software projects often rely on code contributions from a wide variety of developers to extend the capabilities of their software. Project members evaluate these contributions and often engage in extended discussions to decide whether to integrate changes. These discussions have important implications for project management regarding new contributors and evolution of project requirements and direction. We present a study of how developers in open work environments evaluate and discuss pull requests, a primary method of contribution in GitHub, analyzing a sample of extended discussions around pull requests and interviews with GitHub developers. We found that developers raised issues around contributions over both the appropriateness of the problem that the submitter attempted to solve and the correctness of the implemented solution. Both core project members and third-party stakeholders discussed and sometimes implemented alternative solutions to address these issues. Different stakeholders also influenced the outcome of the evaluation by eliciting support from different communities such as dependent projects or even companies. We also found that evaluation outcomes may be more complex than simply acceptance or rejection. In some cases, although a submitter's contribution was rejected, the core team fulfilled the submitter's technical goals by implementing an alternative solution. We found that the level of a submitter's prior interaction on a project changed how politely developers discussed the contribution and the nature of proposed alternative solutions.},

  abstract = {Product data management (PDM) integrates and manages all the information that defines a product, from design to manufacture, and to end-user support. PDM can be seen as an integration tool connecting many different areas, which ensures that the right information in the right form is available to the right person at the right time. When properly implemented, PDM systems will result in faster work, fewer errors, less redundancy, and smoother workflow for an organization. A recent advance in PDM technology concerns with the use of web-based technologies. The objective of this paper is to review PDM technology in general, and discuss the web-based PDM systems in particular. The emphasis is given toward the integration of PDM methodology with web architecture, and how this new infrastructure enhances a traditional PDM system. To reinforce the argument, a number of currently available PDM systems that have embraced web-technologies are reviewed, and some industrial implementations are presented.}

  abstract = { Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a developing paradigm. One way to develop an understanding of PLM's characteristic and boundaries is to propose models that help us conceptualise both holistic and component views in compact packages. Models can give us both a rich way of thinking about overall concepts and can identify areas where we need to explore issues that such models raise. In this paper, the author proposes and discusses two such related models, the Product Lifecycle Management Model (PLM Model) and the Mirrored Spaces Model (MSM) and investigates the conceptual and technical issues raised by these models. }
