\section{Platform design}
\label{sec:contribution}

As explained previously, our platform design comprises a \textbf{data model} and an \textbf{interface model}.
The data model provides an integrated representation of stakeholders, roles, CAD model revisions, design tasks, and project schedules.
In contrast, the interface model demonstrates how a graphical user interface could look like for the application.
In the following, we explain both models in more detail.
